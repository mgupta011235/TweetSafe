*note: you should already have a .pem file from AWS. know the location of this file. This .pem file is your key|secret key file

1. Setup an ec2 instance on AWS. Use community AMI that already has anaconda installed on it. Record the Public DNS and Public IP. 

2. Go to your instance and click on Security Groups in the sidebar. Choose your instance and click on Inbound. Then add a Custom TCP Rule with Port Range 8888 and Source 0.0.0.0/0

3. open a terminal and ssh into ec2 instance. 
ssh -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem ec2-user@IP_Address 

#if using a ubuntu machine, use ubuntu instead of ec2-user

4. you can copy files from your computer to your ec2 instance via the following
#scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem [path to file] ec2-user@ip_address:/path/to/destitation
#[-i identity_file]
scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem Untitled1.ipynb ec2-user@52.205.255.138:

5. install the following in your terminal in this order

#install these
sudo yum update
sudo yum install -y tmux
sudo yum install -y pssh
#sudo yum install -y python27 python27-devel
sudo yum install -y freetype-devel libpng-devel

#this is needed to prevent RuntimeError: Broken toolchain: cannot link a simple C program
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" 

#wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python27

#sudo pip install --upgrade pip
#sudo easy_install-2.7 pip
sudo easy_install py4j

sudo pip install ipython==2.0.0
sudo pip install pyzmq==14.6.0  #ipython notebook needs this
sudo pip install jinja2==2.7.3  #ipython notebook needs this
sudo pip install tornado==4.2   #ipython notebook needs this


sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install scipy
sudo pip install gensim==0.10.3
sudo pip install matplotlib
sudo pip install nltk


6. create a new profile in ipython in the ec2 instance
#ipython profile create [profile_name]
ipython profile create nbserver

7. modify the config file of your new profile so that you can access ipython notebook from any IP address

cd ~/.ipython/profile_nbserver/ (or whatever you decided to call your profile)
ipython
%edit ipython_notebook_config.py 

(under c = get_config(), type the following code)
c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'

(press insert, then start typing, hit esc to exit insert mode, shift + ;,x ENTER)
save and quit

8. open ipython notebook
WATCH OUT: make sure your server is running at "all ip addresses on your system" rather than just 127.0.0.1 (or something like that). You WILL have a bad time.

9. In your browser type 
#http//Public-DNS:Port
http://ec2-52-205-255-138.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8888/
