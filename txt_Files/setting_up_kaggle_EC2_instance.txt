*note: you should already have a .pem file from AWS. know the location of this file. This .pem file is your key|secret key file

1. Setup an ec2 instance on AWS. Use community AMI that already has anaconda installed on it. I choose the kaggle-machine ami-715ccb66. Record the Public DNS and Public IP. 

2. Go to your instance and click on Security Groups in the sidebar. Choose your instance and click on Inbound. Then add a Custom TCP Rule with Port Range 8888 and Source 0.0.0.0/0

3. open a terminal and ssh into ec2 instance. 
ssh -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem ubuntu@IP_Address 

#if using a ubuntu machine, use ubuntu instead of ec2-user

4. you can copy files from your computer to your ec2 instance via the following
#scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem [path to file] ec2-user@ip_address:/path/to/destitation
#[-i identity_file]
scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem Untitled1.ipynb ec2-user@52.205.255.138:

5. in terminal type "pip install gensim==0.10.3" to install gensim

6. upload your script and have fun!!!!!


ssh -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem ubuntu@IP_Address 

#put file on aws instance, this is a terminal on my comp
scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem train_doc2vec_split_only.py ubuntu@52.87.180.28:

#get file from aws instance, this is a terminal on my comp
scp -i ~/Downloads/gupta1.pem ubuntu@54.175.28.165:/home/ubuntu/train_doc2vec_aws.py ./
