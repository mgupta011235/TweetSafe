Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8\" but then you go back and think about it a little \"Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ...

Still alert enough mentally.  Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   \n",
